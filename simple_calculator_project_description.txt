Project Title:

Smart Expression Calculator using Python and Tkinter

Project Description:

This project is a GUI-based smart calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. Unlike basic calculators that handle only two numbers and one operator, this application allows the user to enter complete mathematical expressions (e.g., 3+5*2-(4/2)) and evaluates them accurately using Python's arithmetic capabilities.

The application ensures input validation using regular expressions to prevent any invalid or unsafe characters. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface with on-screen buttons for digits, operations, and parentheses, as well as keyboard support for convenience.

Additionally, the calculator includes a history feature that stores the results of previous calculations and displays them upon request. This feature adds usability for users needing to refer back to recent expressions.

Key Features:

    Supports full mathematical expressions with +, -, *, /, (), and decimals.

    Built with Tkinter for a responsive and user-friendly GUI.

    Safe evaluation of expressions using eval() after regex-based filtering.

    Real-time error handling for syntax errors and division by zero.

    On-screen buttons for mouse input and keyboard bindings for faster use.

    Calculation history displayed via a popup for easy review of previous operations.

    Clean layout mimicking a physical calculator for ease of use.

Technologies Used:

    Python 3

    Tkinter (Standard GUI Library)

    Regular Expressions (re module)

Potential Extensions:

    Replace eval() with a custom expression parser or use ast for safer evaluation.

    Add scientific functions like sin, cos, log, etc.

    Implement theme switching (light/dark mode).

    Add memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC).

    Save history to a file for persistent logs.
